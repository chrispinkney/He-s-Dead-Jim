#### Why

He's Dead, Jim is a small project developed as part of my introduction to the world of Open Source Development, in addition to Git and GitHub.

This is my project. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

#### How

He's Dead, Jim aggregates (a fancy word for saying _grabs_) all href tags on a single page/file and creates get requests for each link on the page. Those requests are then reported back to the user along with the status code and a delightful colour coded message indicating the status of each link.

#### Features

He's Dead Jim features the following optional features:

- Colourized output. Good URLs are printed in green, bad URLs are printed in red, and unknown URLs in gray.
- -v can be supplied to the program for current version information.
- Program incorporates multi-threading to allow for parallelization of the program.

#### Usage / Installation

Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) on your machine and reboot:

> Open a shell/cmd and execute the following commands:
>
> `pip install He-s-Dead-Jim`
>
> `hdj`
