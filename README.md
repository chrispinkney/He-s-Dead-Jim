## INTRODUCTION
My name is Chris and welcome to my OSD600 Repo.

You can find my blog [here](https://dev.to/chrispinkney) which is my retelling of my personal relationship between OSD600 and myself. This repo will serve as a guide to the code I've developed over the next 14 weeks (until December 14 2020).

#### What is OSD600?
OSD600 introduces students to the technological, social, and pragmatic aspects of developing open source software through direct involvement in large open source projects.

Over the course of the term we will learn to use the tools, techniques, and strategies of open source developers.

It is a project-based programming course.

#### What is Telescope?
[Telescope](https://telescope.cdot.systems/) is an open source web server and client application for aggregating and presenting a timeline of Seneca's open source blogs.

Telescope was created in the fall of 2019 by our professor [David Humphrey](https://blog.humphd.org/) and 60 students in Seneca's open source courses OSD600 and DPS909.

You can use it to track all the past and present student's progress over the next 14 weeks.

#### Scope
For our first project we are tasked with building a command-line tool for finding and reporting dead links (e.g., broken URLs) in a file. Users might use the tool to help locate broken URLs in an HTML page, for example. The tool can be written in any programming language.

#### How It Works
It works by Magic.
